#cmd-on-mac
You can have the editor use the `Cmd` key on a Mac, instead of `Ctrl`, by providing a keyboard shortcut to the editor with a slash. For example: `<tool name="Bold" shortcut="Ctrl+B / Cmd+B" />`. When RadEditor detects it is running on a Mac, it will switch from expecting the `Ctrl` key to expecting the `Cmd` key.
